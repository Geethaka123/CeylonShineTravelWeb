# Image Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder images for the About component. To use real photos, replace the following SVG files with actual JPG/PNG images:

## Required Images

1. **owner-photo.jpg** - Company owner/founder photo (recommended: 400x400px or larger)
2. **team-photo.jpg** - Team group photo (recommended: 400x300px or larger)
3. **team-member-1.jpg** - Operations Director photo (recommended: 200x200px or larger)
4. **team-member-2.jpg** - Creative Director photo (recommended: 200x200px or larger)

## Image Guidelines

- Use high-quality, professional photos
- Ensure good lighting and clear faces
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios
- Optimize images for web (compress if needed)
- Use JPG format for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency

## How to Replace

1. Add your real photos to this directory
2. Update the file names to match the ones listed above
3. The component will automatically use the new images

## Current Placeholders

The SVG files currently in this directory are simple placeholders that will be replaced when you add real photos.
